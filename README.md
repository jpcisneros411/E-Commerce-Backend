  ## Description 

  This is a submission for a FSF bootcamp offered through SMU. This Database utilizes Express.js, Sequlize, and MySQL in order to create a functional database that can be used for commerce as it allows a user to store products with different names, tags, and categories. It also lays out the relationships between the different items in the database such as how "product" belongs to many "Tag". A very fun and exciting offering.  


  ## Installation
